  <h3>Sector 2: Electricity Grid</h3>

  <p>Electricity is generated from many sources. Those sources feed the electricity grid that serves the DVRPC region. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) <a href="https://www.epa.gov/egrid">Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID)</a> identifies the electricity generation sources that serve our region.¹ You will notice that natural gas, coal, oil, and other fossil fuels account for about 56% of our electricity mix. Nuclear, a zero-GHG emissions energy source, accounts for about 40%. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar and net-zero carbon sources like biomass, biogas, and hydropower account for just over 4 percent. </p>

  <p>Electricity consumption currently accounts for only about 30 percent of regional energy usage, including both stationary and mobile energy. That means that over 70 percent of energy consumption is direct fossil fuel combustion, primarily to heat buildings and move vehicles. In order to achieve a net-zero carbon future, electricity will need to become the primary form of energy consumed while simultaneously decarbonizing the electricity grid mix. Switching from fossil fuel combustion to electricity is known as electrification. </p>

  <p>Explore the difference generation sources can make in our region’s greenhouse gas emissions by changing the mix of various source inputs. Please be sure that the source mix percentages total 100 percent. The text above the inputs will turn red if you are over 100 percent or orange if you are below 100 percent.</p>

  <p>Decarbonizing the electrical grid is essential to achieving a net-zero carbon future. Without a decarbonized grid, the region will always be dependent on fossil fuels. To learn more about how DVRPC is helping municipalities in the region promote renewable energy, please visit DVRPC’s <a href="https://www.dvrpc.org/EnergyClimate/AEOWG/">renewable energy ordinance frameworks</a> and <a href="http://www.dvrpc.org/solar">solar best practices pages</a>.</p>

  <p>Fully decarbonizing the electricity grid creates many opportunities and benefits for the region. By encouraging distributed renewable enrgy systems, like solar PV, local governments can help residents and businesses access energy cost savings. More distributed, renewable energy leads to more resilient energy infrastructure, especially when paired with microgrids that can isolate power outages and keep the rest of the grid running. Extensive grid decarbonization will also create new jobs throughout the region, both in the construction and installation of renewable energy generation and in the upgrade and expansion of the electrical grid. Removing fossil fuel power generation from the grid will also improve air and water quality to their surrounding areas. </p>

  <p>1. Greater Philadelphia lies in the subregion known as ReliabilityFirst Corporation East (RFCE). For the 2015 Inventory, DVRPC averaged the grid mix and emissions for RFCE found in eGRID 2014 and eGRID 2016. This grid mix is shown in the pie chart.</p>

  <h3>Sector 2: Electricity Grid</h3>

  <p class="header-paragraph">
  Electricity consumption currently accounts for about 30% of regional energy usage, including both stationary and mobile energy. That means that over 70% of energy consumption is direct fossil fuel combustion. In order to progress to a net-zero carbon future, electricity will need to become 100% of energy consumption. Switching from fossil fuel combustion to electricity is known as electrification. 
  </p>

  <p class="header-paragraph">
  However, replacing fossil fuel combustion with electricity will not always result in fewer GHG emissions. Electricity is generated from many sources. Those sources contribute to the electricity grid that serves the DVRPC region. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) identifies the electricity generation sources that serve various subregions. Greater Philadelphia lies in the subregion known as ReliabilityFirst Corporation East (RFCE). For the 2015 Inventory, DVRPC averaged the grid mix and emissions for RFCE found in eGRID 2014 and eGRID 2016. This grid mix is shown in the pie chart. You will notice that natural gas, coal, oil, and other fossil fuels account for about 56% of our electricity mix. Nuclear, a zero-GHG emissions energy source, accounts for about 40%. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar and net-zero carbon sources like biomass, biogas, and hydropower account for just over 4%.

  <p class="header-paragraph">
  Decarbonization of the electrical grid is essential to achieving a net-zero carbon future. Without a decarbonized grid, the region will always be dependent on fossil fuels. To learn more about how DVRPC is helping municipalities in the region promote renewable energy, please visit DVRPC’s renewable energy ordinance frameworks and solar best practices pages.

  <p class="header-paragraph">
  Fully decarbonizing the electricity grid creates many opportunities and benefits for the region. To accomplish this, local governments will need to encourage distributed renewable energy systems, like solar PV. More distributed generation can provide energy cost savings for residents and businesses. It also leads to more resilient energy infrastructure, especially when paired with microgrids that can isolate power outages and keep the rest of the grid running. Extensive grid decarbonization will also create new jobs throughout the region, both in the construction and installation of renewable energy generators and the upgrade and expansion of the electrical grid. Removing fossil fuel power generation from the grid will also improve air and water quality to their surrounding areas, which are generally populated by racial and ethnic minorities and those with lower household incomes.

  <h3> Sector 3: Residential Energy Consumption</h3>
  
  <p>Residential energy consumption refers to the energy consumed in the home. This includes fuels directly combusted for space and water heating and cooking and the electricity that powers air conditioning, lighting, and other appliances. Residential stationary energy use contributed over 20 percent of regional greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, with emissions from natural gas combustion and the fuels used for electricity generation being the largest contributors.¹</p>

  <p>Attaining net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the residential energy sector will require governments and residents to pursue two major goals: </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Reducing energy consumption through energy conservation and energy efficiency, and</li>
    <li>Electrifying everything in the home. This will be a common theme through this tool. Stopping the reliance of burning fossil fuels for energy is essential to eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. Local governments, businesses, and residents can all take steps to reduce the use of fossil fuels for energy by switching to electric end uses and continuing to work toward decarbonizing the electricity grid mix. Examples of end uses to electrify in the home include replacing gas or oil furnaces with heat pumps and replacing gas ranges with electric ranges.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Move the sliders on the right to see how achieving these goals will affect greenhouse gas emissions in the region.</p>

  <p>The activities needed to reduce GHG emissions from residential buildings provide a host of additional benefits for the region’s households. Electrifying home end uses like space heaters, water heaters, and kitchen ranges significantly improves indoor air quality, reducing asthma rates in children. Residents would also no longer need to worry about dangerous gases and chemicals associated with fossil fuel combustion, such as carbon monoxide. </p>

  <p>Energy efficiency improvements in homes can drastically reduce energy bills while keeping homes cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Residential energy efficiency and electrification campaigns also create jobs, benefiting the local economy. Through energy efficiency and electrification, regional residents can live in healthier homes for less money and create good-paying, local jobs.</p>

  <p>1. Note that emissions from electricity generation are assigned to the locations where the electricity is used, not generated.

  <h3>Sector 8: Other Mobile Energy Use</h3>

  <p class="header-paragraph">
  There are two other sources of mobile GHG emissions: Marine and port-related activity and off-road vehicles and equipment. 
  </p>

  <p class="header-paragraph">
  The marine and port-related activity sector includes fuel consumption, energy use, and emissions estimates for ocean-going vessels, harbor craft, port-side cargo-handling equipment, and heavy trucks idling in the port area. In addition to emissions directly within a port area, DVRPC also included fuel consumption, energy use, and emissions of ships in transit within the Delaware Bay area. This sector accounted for 0.4% of regional GHG emissions in 2015.
  </p>

  <p class="header-paragraph">
  Off-road vehicles and equipment include off-road recreational vehicles, pleasure craft, and lawn and garden vehicles and equipment. DVRPC excluded agriculture equipment, airport support equipment, commercial equipment, construction equipment, industrial equipment, logging equipment, oil field equipment, railway equipment, and underground mining equipment, as energy use and emissions for these categories are included in the commercial, industrial, and freight/passenger rail sections of the inventory. In 2015, off-road vehicles and equipment accounted for 0.7% of regional GHG emissions. 
  </p>

  <p class="header-paragraph">
  Decarbonization of these other mobile sources will require: 
  Reducing energy consumption. This can be through efficiency gains or by decreases in activity or usage.
  Electrifying the equipment. Electrification of most off-road equipment is doable. For marine and port uses, electrification may take the form of green hydrogen. 
  </p>

  <p class="header-paragraph">
  Move the sliders to the right to see how achieving these actions will affect greenhouse gas emissions in the region. 
  </p>

  <p class="header-paragraph">
  For ports, decarbonization can provide significant air quality benefits, especially for neighborhoods surrounding the ports. Energy use reduction, combined with electrification, would mean less idling of port equipment, quieter port activity, and less pollution in waterways.
  </p>

  <p class="header-paragraph">
  For off-road vehicles and equipment, electrification will make for quieter neighborhoods. Lawn and garden equipment will be much quieter and there will be no exhaust fumes lingering as children play in the yard. Electric pleasure craft can reduce pollution in lakes and streams, preventing that oily sheen seen on some of the more active waters. This will make swimming and fishing in those areas more pleasant for non-boaters, both in water cleanliness and quieter pleasure craft. Electric off-road recreational vehicles, pleasure craft, and lawn and garden equipment will all be cheaper to fuel.
